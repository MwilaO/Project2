    <hr />
    <p>My name is Mwila Otieno. I am an aspiring software engineer currently living<br>
        in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I was born overseas in Lusaka, Zambia to a mother<br>
        from the Bemba tribe, and a father from the Kenyan Luo tribe. My family<br>
        moved to the United States when I was two years old, settling in Pittsburgh.</p>
        
        <br />

    <p>For the majority of my schooling, due to financial hardships, my older brother and<br>
        I were homeschooled, which gave us both the opportunity to be around computers.<br>
        Because our parents both had backgrounds related to tech (Engineer and Computer<br>
        Scientist), we were heavily encouraged to learn how to progran. However, due to<br>
        stress from home life and untreated depression, it took me years of searching and<br>
        self reflection before I had the strength to pursue programming in earnest.</p>

        <br />

    <p>After several months of hard work and teaching myself the necessary code, I find<br>
        myself where I am today. Prepared to move forward into the world of software<br>
        engineering with confidence in myself and in my abilities.</p>
